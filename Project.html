    <h4>Coffee</h4>
    <p>Coffee has a complex blend of multiple inherent flavours based on how it is grown and processed.
    Coffee preferences of people are mostly based on two factors – aroma and taste. 
    So taste notes are basically just quick guides to the aroma and taste profile of the coffee. 
    These aroma profiles along with flavour profiles, help differentiate different types of coffee and roasts. 
    Light roasted coffees tend to maintain higher levels of the distinguishing notes as compared to darker 
    roasted coffees which often start tasting similar. Other aspects that influence the aroma are brewing methods, 
    origin of the coffee, the flora and fauna that surrounds the coffee plants, processing methods and a myriad of 
    other factors. Clear up till here? Let’s try to understand it better. Coffee will at the end of the day taste 
    like coffee itself, you need not worry about that. Taste notes are just subtle deviations from the normal taste 
    of the coffee. That is the reason I insisted upon not considering these taste notes as flavours
    For example, you end up buying a coffee with the taste note of melon. The coffee will not taste like melon or 
    fruit juice for that matter. Rather it will just have a hint of sweetness and fruity flavour and still taste like 
    the coffee you know.
    </p>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in 
      the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. 
      The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into 
      fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

    <h4>Cake</h4>
    <p>Cakes are a requisite to celebrate every occasion. It adds so much of sweetness and delicacy in one’s life. 
      Trigger those delightful moments in your loved ones lives by sending them best cakes online. If you couldn't 
      reach at your sister’s birthday party this year, then don’t be disheartened. Order cake online Dubai and across
      UAE from our cake online shop and make it a momentary celebration for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, 
      cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which 
      share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.
    </p>
    <p>The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a leavening agent, 
      such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts 
      such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or 
      dessert sauces (like custard, jelly, cooked fruit, whipped cream or syrups), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated 
      with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.</p>
      <p>Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are 
        countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a 
        complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking 
        equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.
      </p>

      <h4>Shakes</h4>
      <p>A milkshake (sometimes simply called a shake) is a sweet beverage made by blending milk, ice cream, and flavorings 
        or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate syrup, fruit syrup, or whole fruit into a thick, sweet, 
        cold mixture. It may also be made using a base made from non-dairy products, including plant milks such as almond milk, 
        coconut milk, or soy milk. Milkshakes originated in the United States around the turn of the 20th century, and grew in 
        popularity following the introduction of electric blenders in the subsequent two decades. They became a common part of 
        youth popular culture, as ice cream shops were a culturally acceptable meeting place for youth, and milkshakes became 
        symbolic of the innocence of youth.
        </p>
        <p>Full-service restaurants, ice cream shops, soda fountains, and diners usually prepare the shake in a milkshake machine. 
          At home, a blender is more commonly used. Milkshakes may be made from any flavor of ice cream; additional flavorings, 
          such as chocolate syrup, malt syrup, or malted milk powder, are often added prior to mixing. Many fast food outlets do 
          not make shakes from the individual ingredients; rather, they use automatic milkshake machines which freeze and serve a 
          pre-made milkshake mixture consisting of milk, a sweetened flavoring agent, and a thickening agent. These are similar to 
          soft-serve ice cream machines, but keep the shake at a drinkable consistency.
          </p>
          <p>When the term "milkshake" was first used in print in 1885, milkshakes were an alcoholic whiskey drink that has been described
             as a "sturdy, healthful eggnog type of drink, with eggs, whiskey, etc., served as a tonic as well as a treat". However, 
             by 1900, the term referred to "wholesome drinks made with chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla syrups." By the "early 1900s people 
             were asking for the new treat, often with ice cream." By the 1930s, milkshakes were a popular drink at malt shops, which were 
             the "typical soda fountain of the period ... used by students as a meeting place or hangout.
